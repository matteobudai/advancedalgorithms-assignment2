\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
For this assignment, we implemented and analyzed the running times and the errors of three algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem. 
The algorithms implemented are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
	\item Random Insertion Algorithm
	\item 2-approximate Algorithm
\end{enumerate}
