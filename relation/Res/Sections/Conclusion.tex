\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

 From the Error Comparison graph and Results table, we initially observe for the instances less than 50 coordinates the approximation error of nearest neighbor grows rapidly as compared to random insertion and 2-approximate. However, as the number of coordinates grows past 50, nearest neighbor outperforms 2-approximate, and eventually each algorithm has a steady approximation error. 2-approximate hovers around 40\%, nearest neighbor around 20\%, and random insertion around 10\%.

 \noindent From the Time Comparison graph and Results table, we can observe that for instances less than 493 coordinates, all three algorithms have similar execution times. At 1000 coordinates, the execution times of nearest neighbor and 2 approximate algorithms increase to around 30 seconds, while the random insertion algorithm only increases to 15 seconds.

 \noindent With respect to the approximation error, the random insertion algorithm overwhelmingly out-performs nearest neighbor and 2-approximate.
 
 \linebreak
 
\noindent Considering both the approximation error and the execution time, we observe that the random insertion algorithm is the most efficient.
